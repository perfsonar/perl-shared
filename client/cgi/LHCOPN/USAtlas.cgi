=head1 NAME

USAtlas.cgi - List 'USATLAS' encoded hLS instances and check if they are responsive.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Relies on a caching program (USAtlas.pl) to build up the list of instances that
match USATLAS related keywords in the gLS.  The cache program also determines
liveness.  This CGI is really for display only.
